### 30 July
- Read `A Historical Survey of Music Recommendation Systems - Towards Evaluation`
### 11 August
- Normalize database by extracting Artist and Album information from Tracks to their own models

## Phase 3 - Recommendation Pipeline
### 12 August
- Store information about high-level features (acousticness, danceability) in vector files instead of in the DB
- Implement a script that makes recommendations based on the cosine similarity of audio features
- Notice that tracks are tagged imprecisely when it comes to genre(eg. Metallica tagged as electronic music)
- Genre and decade prefiltering will be needed to increase accuracy
### 13 August
- Update the DB build script so that for tracks that have duplicates we select the most common values for genre and high-level features instead defaulting to the 1st submission and discarding the rest.
### 19 August
- Refine recommendation logic: pre-filter candidate tracks to be same genre and decade as target track, avoid duplicated tracks
### 20 August
- Decrease DB build time by 64 seconds (17% improvement) by using `orjson` package instead of native json to parse the dataset record files
### 21 August
- Begin API development, add endpoint for track details `api/track/<str:musicbrainz_recordingid>/`
- Extract recommendation logic to a separate module
### 22 August
- Add tests for recommendation logic
- Add endpoint for making recommendations `api/similar/`
### 23 August
- Add tests for recommendation endpoint

## Phase 4 - API Expansion
### 03 September
- Iron out data processing:
  - Add script for compiling many JSON files into one NDJSON to speed up data ingest process by reducing file open/close overhead. Dataset load time time went from 33s to 29s for 100k records (it's going to matter for 30M records).
  - Update DB build script to accept either path to JSON files or path to merged NDJSON (split into multiple functions if needed), store paths in some sort of `.env` file
  - Refactor scripts as Django commands: merging JSON files (`python manage.py merge_json`), building db (`python manage.py build_db`), showing recommendation in console (`python manage.py recommend`)
- Ensure metadata correctness: when processing the MBID must match a standard format (regex)
### 04 September
- Select most common values for album and artists when merging tracks, previously we were populating these fields with the values from the first encountered instance of a track.
- Track how many duplicates each track has and store in DB under `submissions` in `Track` model.
### 05 September
- Modify how data is loaded into the DB:
  - Data is read directly from the dump archives (`.tar.zst` format)
  - Archives are processed in parallel as separate tasks (futures) `ThreadPoolExecutor > process_archive`
  - Inside each thread, the archive is decompressed and its contained JSON files are streamed and processed sequentially (relevant data is extracted from JSON files)
  - As each future completes, it creates a list of processed tracks which can be further processed in subsequent phases of the pipeline
- Streaming the data removes the need to unzip the archives manually. We also don't need to worry about file access bottlenecks and don't need to merge the millions of JSON files into NDJSONs.
### 06 September
- Include `moods_mirex` as an audio feature, increasing feature space to 16, document improvement in recommendation rankings
- Converted artist info and album info fields on tracks from required to optional during data ingest. This means fewer tracks will get dropped from the DB because of missing information. We can rely on merging duplicates to fill-in artist data and drop tracks that don't have an associated artist after merge.
### 07 September
- Make album dates optional, the album name can still be recorded in DB even without a release date. Tracks in the feature matrix can have year=0.
- If an artist shows up under different names for the same id, merge the names by selecting the most common one, should help deal with mislabelled artists
- Generate charts with genre distributions based on feature matrix, useful for report later on
- Experiment with recommendation logic and describe choice of which features to use in report
- Test out re-ranking recommended songs based on popularity (`submissions` count)
### 08 September
- Switched DB from SQLite to PostgreSQL
  - Query speed significantly faster, from 15s to 0.007s for a 4-table inner join with string matching in DBeaver (5M tracks dataset, 2M rows in DB after merging duplicated). This is great for quickly checking the DB during development.
  - Postgres provides extra features like trigram matching for strings which will be required for search.
- Saw an increase in data ingest script execution times, perf tweaks were applied, afterwards times are back to normal
  - Increasing batch size for `bulk_create` from 2K to 20K
  - Wrap DB inserts in `transaction.atomic()`
  - Set `synchronous_commit` off
### 09 September
- Design API
- Rework earlier API implementation, add endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/tracks|albums|artists/` - list and details for DB models
    - `GET /api/v1/tracks/<mbid>/features/` - returns audio feature values (raw and scaled) from feature matrix
    - `GET /api/v1/albums/<mbid>/art/` - redirects to https://coverartarchive.org/ for cover art
    - `GET /api/v1/artists/<mbid>/tracks/` - all tracks by artist
    - `GET /api/v1/artists/<mbid>/top_tracks/` - top tracks by artist
    - `GET /api/v1/artists/<mbid>/albums/` - all albums artist is on
  - `POST /api/v1/recommend/` - post with MBID to get recommendations for similar songs
  - `GET /api/v1/genres/` - show all possible genre tags in DB

### 10 September
- Add ordering for tracks, artists, albums endpoints
- Add HATEOAS-style links to tracks, artists, albums endpoints through a serializer method field `get_links()`.
- Implement search endpoint (`GET /api/v1/search/`) - trigram similarity

### 11 September
- Added API documentation through `drf-spectacular`
  - `GET api/v1/schema/` - openapi schema YAML
  - `GET api/v1/swagger-ui/` - SWAGGER style docs
  - `GET api/v1/redoc/` - REDOC style docs
- Refine recommend endpoint
  - Filters for matching genre and decade
  - Option to exclude songs by MBID
  - Specify genre matching classifier: dortmund, rosamerica
  - Limit for number of results
  - Total weights: similarity vs popularity

### 12 September
- Added skeleton for front-end app that consumes the API using Vite, React, TypeScript
- Add FE methods for querying API, types for serializer responses
- Implement search front-end
- Annotate search results in API with trigram similarity score and sort by it so most relevant results are returned first. This adds 300-600ms (0.119s -> 0.463s) to query time but it's a necessary trade-off to make the results relevant to the user.
- Boost performance of search query by creating a GiST index, now 0.028s and with relevant results

### 13 September
- Implement endpoint for getting YouTube playable sources for tracks: `GET /api/v1/tracks/<mbid>/sources/`. Uses YouTube Data API to search for a videos, the query is track title + artist name.
