# TasteMender: A stateless music recommendation API

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Created as a final project for UoL BScCS (CM3070) by Valentin Radulescu.

## Installation

1. Install required software: `Python@3.12.4`, `PostgreSQL@17.6`, `Node.js@v20.17.0 `

2. Create a config file in `backend/.env` with DB login information, see `.env.example`

3. Build the DB (see below)

4. Install Django dependencies, check that everything is running:
```bash
cd backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py test
python manage.py runserver
```

5. Install React dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend/
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building the database from scratch
Ideally you should have access to the already-built database in SQLite format and the features NPZ file. If this isn't the case you can replicate the DB from scratch using the instructions below. For development, the **sample** data should be enough.

The first step is to download the dataset dumps from AcousticBrainz, these contain track metadata and the audio features used to determine song similarity, link: https://acousticbrainz.org/download. I recommend using a structure like this:

- `AcousticBrainz`
  - `Sample`
    - `acousticbrainz-highlevel-sample-json-20220623-0.tar.zst`
  - `High-Level`
    - `acousticbrainz-highlevel-json-20220623-0.tar.zst`
    - `acousticbrainz-highlevel-json-20220623-1.tar.zst`
    - `...`

You download the datasets from a browser or by using these commands:

```bash
# Sample DB dump with 100k entries, good for development
mkdir Sample
cd Sample
wget -P . https://data.metabrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/acousticbrainz/dumps/acousticbrainz-sample-json-20220623/acousticbrainz-highlevel-sample-json-20220623-0.tar.zst

# Full DB dump with 30M entries, good for production
mkdir High-level
cd High-level
wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=5 -P . https://data.metabrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/acousticbrainz/dumps/acousticbrainz-highlevel-json-20220623/

# Check that the downloaded files aren't corrupted
sha256sum -c sha256sums
```

Then update the project's `.env` file with the paths to the dumps, ex:

```bash
AB_HIGHLEVEL_ROOT=D:/Datasets/AcousticBrainz/High-level
AB_SAMPLE_ROOT=D:/Datasets/AcousticBrainz/Sample
```

Finally you can now build the SQLite database and the features file (`features_and_index.npz`):

```bash
# Build the Django DB and the in-memory vector store for audio features
python manage.py build_db # Use all available parts of dataset OR
python manage.py build_db --parts 2 # Use 2 parts of dataset OR
python manage.py build_db --sample # Use the sample dataset with 100k entries
```

## Repo Structure

- `backend/`
  - `music_recommendation/` - the main Django project
  - `recommend_api/` - recommendation API
    - `services/`
      - `recommender.py` - recommendation logic
      - `youtube_sources.py` - gets playable sources for tracks
    - `tests/` - unit tests
    - `api.py` - endpoint views
  - `ingest/` - scripts for building the DB
    - `management/commands/`
      - `build_db.py` - dataset ingest and DB build command
      - `recommend.py` - command for showing recommendations
- `frontend/` - standalone app that consumes the API
